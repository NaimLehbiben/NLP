# Project goals

We address the problem of image captioning, which involves describing the visual content of an image with a sentence in natural language. We will implement a simplified version of the "show and tell" approach developped by Oriol Vinyals, Alexander Toshev, Samy Bengio, and Dumitru Erhan.
